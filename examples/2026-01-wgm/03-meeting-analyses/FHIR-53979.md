# FHIR-53979: Capture Level of Adoption per Resource

## Issue Overview

Michael Donnelly raises a concern about losing valuable adoption signals when R6 declares all resources normative. While he agrees with the rationale for this approach (normative status reflects specification maturity, not adoption), he notes that implementers currently use maturity levels as a proxy for understanding how broadly a resource has been adopted.

The proposal is to create a mechanism to track adoption on a per-resource basis, separate from the frozen R6 specification. This tracking could include information about which organizations have implemented each resource and in which countries it is in use. Each resource would link to this adoption information directly.

This is a metadata and implementer guidance issue - helping implementers make informed decisions about which resources have real-world validation.

## Current State

In R5 and earlier:
- FMM (FHIR Maturity Model) levels provided rough indication of resource maturity
- Implementers often interpreted FMM as a proxy for adoption/real-world usage
- Higher FMM suggested more implementation experience

In R6:
- All resources will be declared normative
- FMM levels will no longer provide differentiation
- No mechanism currently exists to track or communicate adoption levels

The reporter mentions:
- Chris Schaut is exploring whether HL7 staff would be interested in developing an adoption tracking solution
- Fallback option: templated Confluence pages (reporter willing to help)

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Reporter (Michael Donnelly)**: Represents implementer perspective - needs guidance on which resources have real-world validation beyond specification maturity. Willing to contribute to solution development.

## Related Issues & Discussions

**Zulip**: Discussions in #R4A/B/R5 Discussion about maturity levels and adoption:
- Lloyd McKenzie: "safe to use = normative and maybe FMM 4 & 5" - indicating FMM has been used as safety signal
- Gino Canessa: "compatibility issue only exists for low-maturity resources, which are not widely adopted (by definition?)" - showing FMM/adoption conflation

**Related context**:
- FHIR's maturity model historically conflated specification quality with implementation adoption
- The R6 normative approach intentionally separates these concepts
- Community has requested better adoption visibility in various forums

## Technical Considerations

1. **Data collection challenges**: How would adoption data be collected? Self-reporting? Surveys? Registry analysis?

2. **Definition of "adoption"**: What constitutes adoption - production use? Read support? Write support? Full CRUD?

3. **Maintenance burden**: Adoption data becomes stale quickly without ongoing updates.

4. **Privacy/business concerns**: Some organizations may not want to publicly disclose their FHIR implementation details.

5. **Linking mechanism**: How would the frozen R6 spec link to external, evolving adoption data?

6. **Geographic and sector variations**: Adoption varies significantly by region (US vs EU vs Asia) and sector (acute care vs payer vs research).

7. **IG-based adoption**: Much FHIR adoption is through IGs (US Core, IPS, etc.) rather than base resources. How does this factor in?

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: HL7-Managed Adoption Registry
- **Description**: HL7 creates and maintains an official adoption tracking system linked from resource pages
- **Pros**: 
  - Authoritative source
  - Consistent methodology
  - Clear governance
- **Cons**: 
  - Significant ongoing resource commitment
  - Data collection challenges
  - May lag real-world adoption
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (external to spec)

### Option B: Community-Driven Confluence Pages
- **Description**: Create templated Confluence pages per resource, allow community editing
- **Pros**: 
  - Lower barrier to contribution
  - Leverages community knowledge
  - Reporter willing to help build
- **Cons**: 
  - Quality/accuracy concerns
  - May become outdated
  - Less authoritative
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (external to spec)

### Option C: Integration with FHIR Registry/Package System
- **Description**: Track adoption through FHIR package registry (IGs using resources)
- **Pros**: 
  - Automated data collection
  - Objective metric (IG usage)
  - Builds on existing infrastructure
- **Cons**: 
  - IG usage ≠ production implementation
  - Doesn't capture direct resource adoption
  - Technical complexity
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (external to spec)

### Option D: Defer Decision / Note as Future Work
- **Description**: Acknowledge need, defer implementation to post-R6 timeframe
- **Pros**: 
  - Doesn't delay R6
  - Allows more time for design
- **Cons**: 
  - Doesn't address immediate implementer need
  - May lose momentum
- **Impact**: None (deferred)

### Option E: Resource-Level Usage Notes
- **Description**: Add informational "Usage in Practice" notes to resource pages based on known implementations
- **Pros**: 
  - Immediate, actionable information
  - Part of spec (though informational)
  - Can be updated in technical corrections
- **Cons**: 
  - Quickly becomes stale
  - Subjective
  - Adds maintenance burden to spec
- **Impact**: Non-substantive

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. Is adoption tracking within FHIR-I's scope, or should this go to FMG/HL7 management?

2. What is the minimum viable adoption tracking that would be useful to implementers?

3. Should adoption be tracked at resource level, profile level, or IG level?

4. What data sources could realistically feed an adoption tracking system?

5. Who would maintain this information long-term?

6. Should the R6 spec include any links to external adoption information, even if the mechanism isn't built yet?
