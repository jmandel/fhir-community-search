# FHIR-54023: Requirements.statement.category does not define a binding to an explicit ValueSet

## Issue Overview

Richard Ettema identifies that `Requirements.statement.category` has an Example binding strength but no explicit ValueSet is defined. While the element description provides guidance on usage, an explicitly defined example ValueSet would benefit implementers by providing concrete codes to use.

The reporter proposes a specific set of codes with a new code system (`http://hl7.org/fhir/requirement-category`) covering common requirement categories: functional, performance, security, usability, scalability, and accessibility.

This is a completeness and implementer experience issue - example bindings should have actual examples.

## Current State

**Requirements.statement.category:**
- Type: Coding (0..*)
- Binding: Example strength
- Bound to: No explicit ValueSet defined
- Description: Provides guidance on intended use but no concrete codes

**Element description from spec:**
The category element is intended to allow classification of requirements statements by type.

**Proposed codes (from reporter):**

| Code | Display | Definition |
|------|---------|------------|
| functional | Functional | Specific behaviors, features, and operations of an implementation |
| performance | Performance | Speed, responsiveness, and stability under load |
| security | Security | Protection against unauthorized access and data breaches |
| usability | Usability | How easily a user can navigate and understand the interface |
| scalability | Scalability | How well the system handles growth in users or data |
| accessibility | Accessibility | Compliance with standards (like ADA) for users with disabilities |

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Reporter (Richard Ettema)**: As an implementer working with the Requirements resource, Richard has direct experience with the need for concrete example codes. The proposed codes align with standard software requirements categorization.

No other comments yet.

## Related Issues & Discussions

**Zulip**: No direct discussions found on Requirements.statement.category. The Requirements resource is relatively new and used primarily in FHIR specification development and quality reporting contexts.

**Context:**
- The Requirements resource was added to support specification development
- Used by IGs to document requirements
- Category allows organizing requirements by type

## Technical Considerations

1. **Example vs Required**: Example binding means implementations can use other codes - but having examples helps interoperability.

2. **Alignment with standards**: The proposed categories align with IEEE/ISO software requirements standards (functional vs non-functional requirements).

3. **FHIR-specific categories**: Should there be FHIR-specific categories (interoperability, conformance, validation)?

4. **Extensibility**: Example binding allows extension, but having a base set provides common vocabulary.

5. **Code system location**: Should this be a FHIR core code system or in THO (terminology.hl7.org)?

6. **Resource maturity**: Requirements resource is relatively new - is the category list well-understood?

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Accept Proposed ValueSet
- **Description**: Create the ValueSet and code system as proposed by reporter
- **Pros**: 
  - Ready-made solution
  - Aligns with industry standards
  - Addresses implementer need
- **Cons**: 
  - May not cover all FHIR-specific needs
  - Might need refinement
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (example binding content)

### Option B: Expanded ValueSet with FHIR-Specific Categories
- **Description**: Start with proposed codes, add FHIR-relevant categories (interoperability, conformance, etc.)
- **Pros**: 
  - More comprehensive
  - FHIR-appropriate
  - Still example binding, so extensible
- **Cons**: 
  - More work to define
  - May be overkill for example binding
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (example binding content)

### Option C: Reference External Standard
- **Description**: Point to existing requirements categorization standards (ISO/IEC 25010, IEEE) rather than creating new
- **Pros**: 
  - Leverages established standards
  - More comprehensive frameworks exist
- **Cons**: 
  - External standards may not be freely available
  - May be overly complex for FHIR usage
  - Adoption challenges
- **Impact**: Non-substantive

### Option D: Minimal Example Set
- **Description**: Create small set of most common categories as examples, document that implementations should extend
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple starting point
  - Clear it's just examples
  - Low risk
- **Cons**: 
  - May not be comprehensive enough
  - Leaves questions for implementers
- **Impact**: Non-substantive

### Option E: Leave Unbound with Better Documentation
- **Description**: Document expected usage patterns without binding to specific codes
- **Pros**: 
  - Maximum flexibility
  - No maintenance burden
- **Cons**: 
  - Doesn't address reporter's concern
  - No interoperability benefit
  - Unusual to have Example binding with no examples
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (documentation only)

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. Are the proposed categories appropriate for FHIR requirements categorization?

2. Should FHIR-specific categories be added (interoperability, conformance, terminology, etc.)?

3. Should this align with external requirements management standards?

4. Where should the code system be published - FHIR core or THO?

5. Is the Requirements resource mature enough to know what categories are needed?

6. Are there other Requirements resource issues that should be addressed together?
