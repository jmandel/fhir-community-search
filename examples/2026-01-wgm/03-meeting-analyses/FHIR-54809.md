# FHIR-54809: Claim as "fully normative specification"

## Issue Overview

This ballot comment challenges the statement "This specification is fully normative" in the R6 Ballot Roadmap page. The commenter correctly notes that this claim is contradicted by the existence of numerous pages designated as "Informative," including the ballot-intro.html page itself.

The request is for clear rationale about what "fully normative" means given the mixed content.

## Current State

The ballot-intro.html page states:
- "This specification is fully normative..."
- But the page itself is marked as "Standards Status: Informative"

Examining the R6 ballot:
- Many resources are marked Normative
- Infrastructure pages are marked Normative
- But many pages are marked Informative:
  - The ballot intro page
  - Various examples
  - Some guidance pages
  - Workflow page (per FHIR-53901)
  - Others

The term "fully normative" is imprecise when informative content exists.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Chris Melo (Reporter)**: Requests "clear rationale provided as to whether all content is normative or not." Concerned about the misleading nature of the "fully normative" claim.

**Same reporter filed FHIR-54807** about conflicting breaking change statements on the same page, suggesting broader concerns about clarity of the ballot roadmap.

## Related Issues & Discussions

### Related Issues
- **FHIR-54807**: Same reporter, same page - conflicting statements about breaking changes
- **FHIR-53901**: Notes workflow page is informative but addresses normative content

### Historical Context
- R4 had limited normative content (specific resources/types)
- R5 was entirely trial-use
- R6 is the first attempt at a "fully normative" ballot
- The distinction between normative resources and informative documentation has always existed

## Technical Considerations

1. **What "Normative" Typically Means**:
   - Normative: Must be implemented as specified; stability guaranteed
   - Informative: Guidance, examples, explanations; may change; not required

2. **The Necessary Informative Content**:
   - Ballot instructions (like ballot-intro.html) - inherently time-bound
   - Examples - illustrative, not normative
   - Implementation guidance - best practices that may evolve
   - Background/educational material

3. **What "Fully Normative" Could Mean**:
   - All resources are normative (not true - many moved to Additional Resource IGs)
   - All remaining core resources are normative (closer to truth)
   - The normative content is complete/stable (intended meaning?)

4. **Reader Expectations**:
   - "Fully normative" suggests everything is locked down
   - But implementations don't implement informative pages
   - The confusion may be about terminology, not substance

5. **Standards Process**:
   - ANSI standards have normative and informative sections
   - This is standard practice, but needs clear labeling

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Clarify "Fully Normative" Scope
- **Description**: Revise the statement to something like "This specification's resources and data types are fully normative" or "The technical specification content is normative; supporting documentation is informative"
- **Pros**: Accurate; maintains intent; acknowledges distinction
- **Cons**: More verbose; may still not capture all nuance
- **Impact**: Low - editorial clarification

### Option B: Remove "Fully Normative" Claim
- **Description**: Remove the imprecise claim and instead describe the normative/informative distinction explicitly
- **Pros**: Avoids ambiguity; more precise
- **Cons**: Loses the high-level messaging about R6's significance
- **Impact**: Low - editorial revision

### Option C: Add Explicit Definition of Scope
- **Description**: Add a section defining exactly what "normative" means in R6 context, listing categories of normative vs informative content
- **Pros**: Complete clarity; reference for questions; educational
- **Cons**: May be verbose; needs maintenance
- **Impact**: Medium - documentation addition

### Option D: Reference Standards Status Framework
- **Description**: Add link to existing standards status documentation and note that "fully normative" refers to the technical content as categorized by that framework
- **Pros**: Leverages existing documentation; consistent with spec patterns
- **Cons**: Requires readers to follow links; may not satisfy concerns
- **Impact**: Low - editorial addition

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. What did "fully normative specification" intend to communicate?

2. Is there precedent in other HL7 standards for how to describe mixed normative/informative content?

3. Should the ballot roadmap page enumerate what IS and ISN'T normative?

4. Is the informative content clearly marked throughout the specification?

5. Would a glossary entry for "fully normative" in FHIR context help?

6. Should this page be reviewed alongside FHIR-54807 for overall clarity?
