# FHIR-54920: Index Page Levels Need Some Thought

## Issue Overview

This issue raises concerns about the organizational "levels" used on the FHIR specification index page to categorize resource domains. Specifically, the submitter notes an inconsistency between "Medication Definition" (at Level 5 - "Providing the ability to reason about the healthcare process") and the newly added "Biological Products" domain (at Level 4).

The submitter argues that Medication Definition and Biological Products are conceptually equivalent - both are about healthcare products used in day-to-day healthcare. Having them at different levels doesn't make sense and may perpetuate the misconception that Medication Definition resources are only for regulatory or pharmaceutical use cases.

## Current State

The FHIR specification organizes resources into a framework of 5 levels representing increasing complexity:

- **Level 1**: Basic framework
- **Level 2**: Supporting implementation and binding to external resources
- **Level 3**: Linking to real-world concepts in the healthcare system
- **Level 4**: Record-keeping and data exchange
- **Level 5**: Providing the ability to reason about the healthcare process

**Current Level Assignments:**
- Level 5: Clinical Reasoning, Medication Definition
- Level 4: Biological Products (newly added)

The description of Level 5 references "reasoning" which fits Clinical Reasoning but doesn't clearly fit Medication Definition. The submitter suggests Medication Definition was placed at Level 5 simply because it was added around the same time as Clinical Reasoning and needed a new level.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Rik Smithies** (Reporter): 
- Medication Definition has "always been at Level 5" but this "never really made sense"
- While MedicationDefinition has ClinicalUseDefinition (used for reasoning), this is not characteristic of the whole domain
- Concerned about perpetuating the misconception that these resources are only for "regulatory" or "pharma" use
- Believes Biological Products and Medication Definition should be siblings at the same level

No additional comments on this issue yet. Limited Zulip discussion found on the specific topic of FHIR framework levels.

## Related Issues & Discussions

- No directly related Jira issues found
- The framework levels have been relatively static since early FHIR versions
- Biological Products is a new domain added in R6 ballot

## Technical Considerations

1. **Documentation vs Functional**: The levels are primarily organizational/documentation structure, not functional categories. Changing levels doesn't affect resource behavior.

2. **Conceptual Coherence**: The current Level 5 description ("reasoning about the healthcare process") doesn't clearly fit Medication Definition resources like MedicinalProductDefinition, Ingredient, etc.

3. **Perception Impact**: Level placement can affect how implementers perceive resources. Higher levels may seem more specialized or complex.

4. **Historical Baggage**: The levels were established early in FHIR's history and may not have been systematically revisited as resources evolved.

5. **Scope Creep Risk**: Rethinking levels could open a larger discussion about the entire framework organization.

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Move Medication Definition to Level 4
- **Description**: Move Medication Definition resources to Level 4 alongside Biological Products, making them siblings
- **Pros**: Conceptually consistent; addresses the main concern; simple change
- **Cons**: May seem like a demotion; could affect any documentation/training referencing levels
- **Impact**: Non-substantive documentation change

### Option B: Move Biological Products to Level 5
- **Description**: Move Biological Products to Level 5 alongside Medication Definition
- **Pros**: Keeps Medication Definition at established level; maintains the "definitional/specialized" characterization
- **Cons**: Doesn't address the fundamental issue that Level 5 description doesn't fit either
- **Impact**: Non-substantive documentation change

### Option C: Revise Level 5 Description
- **Description**: Update Level 5's description to better encompass both Clinical Reasoning and product definitions (e.g., "Reasoning about healthcare processes and defining healthcare products")
- **Pros**: Addresses the semantic mismatch; keeps current structure
- **Cons**: May make the description less cohesive; doesn't address sibling placement
- **Impact**: Non-substantive documentation change

### Option D: Create Level 4.5 or Reorganize Levels
- **Description**: Add a new level or sublevel for "Healthcare Product Definitions" that includes both Medication Definition and Biological Products
- **Pros**: Clean conceptual organization
- **Cons**: More significant change to documentation; may confuse users familiar with current levels
- **Impact**: Documentation restructuring

### Option E: Defer to Post-R6
- **Description**: Leave current structure for R6; plan a more comprehensive review of the framework for future versions
- **Pros**: Avoids rushed changes; allows broader community input
- **Cons**: Perpetuates the inconsistency; may never get addressed
- **Impact**: No immediate change

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. How much weight do implementers actually place on the framework levels? Is this primarily a documentation concern?

2. Should Medication Definition and Biological Products be at the same level? If so, which level?

3. Is there appetite for a broader review of the framework organization, or should we make minimal targeted changes?

4. Who are the stakeholders for Medication Definition and Biological Products that should weigh in on this?

5. Has the "Level 5 = regulatory/pharma only" misconception actually caused problems in practice?
