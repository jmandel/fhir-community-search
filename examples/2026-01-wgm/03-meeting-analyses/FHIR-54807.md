# FHIR-54807: Conflicting statements on breaking changes

## Issue Overview

This ballot comment identifies a direct contradiction in the R6 Ballot Roadmap page regarding breaking changes from R4 normative content. The two conflicting statements are:

1. "If content was normative in R4, then this specification is not allowed to contain breaking changes to that content under the rules published in this version"

2. "As R5 was not normative, breaking changes from R5 are allowed (even in the R4 normative areas)"

The phrase "even in the R4 normative areas" in statement 2 directly contradicts statement 1. This is a critical inconsistency for implementers who need to understand what compatibility guarantees exist.

## Current State

The ballot-intro.html page (https://hl7.org/fhir/6.0.0-ballot4/ballot-intro.html) section 1.13 contains both statements in close proximity under "notes about breaking changes."

The statements cannot both be true:
- Statement 1: R4 normative content cannot have breaking changes
- Statement 2: R5 changes are allowed "even in R4 normative areas"

If R5 introduced breaking changes to R4 normative content, and those R5 changes carried into R6, then R6 DOES have breaking changes from R4 normative content.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Chris Melo (Reporter)**: Notes that "breaking changes rules are a top priority for implementers" and these statements must be aligned.

### Related Issue
- **FHIR-54809**: Same reporter, same page - questions the "fully normative" claim given informative content exists

### Broader Context
The R6 ballot is the first full normative ballot. R4 had limited normative content. R5 was trial-use. The relationship between these versions' normative status creates complexity.

### What Was Normative in R4?
- Patient (partial)
- Observation (partial)  
- Bundle
- CapabilityStatement
- StructureDefinition
- ValueSet
- CodeSystem
- Several data types
- Infrastructure elements

## Technical Considerations

1. **The Logical Contradiction**:
   - If R4 had normative content X
   - R5 changed X (breaking)
   - R6 inherits R5's version of X
   - Then R6 has breaking changes from R4
   - This contradicts statement 1

2. **Possible Interpretations**:
   - Statement 2 is poorly worded and doesn't mean what it says
   - Statement 1 applies to FUTURE changes, not this ballot
   - There's a distinction being made that isn't clear

3. **Impact on Implementers**:
   - R4 implementers need to know: Can I move to R6 without breaking changes?
   - If answer is "yes" - statement 2 is wrong
   - If answer is "no" - statement 1 is wrong

4. **Rules Reference**: Statement 1 references "rules published in this version" - the inter-version compatibility rules may clarify intent

5. **Practical Reality**: R5 DID make changes to some R4 normative content (e.g., search parameter expressions, some element cardinalities)

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Clarify That R6 May Have Breaking Changes from R4
- **Description**: Revise statement 1 to acknowledge that R6 may contain breaking changes from R4 due to R5 evolution, but FUTURE versions will not break R6 normative content
- **Pros**: Honest; aligns with reality; sets clear future expectations
- **Cons**: May concern R4 implementers; acknowledges instability
- **Impact**: Medium - editorial clarification with policy implications

### Option B: Clarify That R5 Changes in R4 Normative Areas Were Allowed
- **Description**: Explain that R4 normative rules permitted certain evolutionary changes, and R5 changes were within those bounds. R6 continues that content.
- **Pros**: Maintains consistency narrative; explains the nuance
- **Cons**: May not match actual R4 normative rules; complex explanation
- **Impact**: Medium - editorial clarification

### Option C: Remove Statement 2 or Rephrase
- **Description**: Remove the confusing "even in R4 normative areas" phrase, or rephrase to clarify what's actually meant
- **Pros**: Eliminates contradiction; simpler text
- **Cons**: May hide important information about R5 changes
- **Impact**: Low - editorial fix

### Option D: Add Detailed Compatibility Matrix
- **Description**: Instead of ambiguous statements, provide concrete table showing R4→R6 and R5→R6 compatibility for each normative area
- **Pros**: Clear; specific; actionable for implementers
- **Cons**: More work; commits to specific claims that could be wrong
- **Impact**: Medium - documentation addition

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. What is the ACTUAL policy on breaking changes from R4 normative content?

2. Did R5 introduce breaking changes to R4 normative content?

3. If so, is R6 carrying those changes forward?

4. What statement should implementers rely on for planning?

5. Should the inter-version compatibility rules be referenced more explicitly?

6. Is there a detailed R4→R6 compatibility analysis available?
