# FHIR-54783: Trial use elements in normative resources

## Issue Overview

This ballot comment raises a fundamental concern about how FHIR can continue to evolve once core resources become normative in R6. The commenter notes that:

1. Trial-use changes in normative resources currently require extensions
2. Extensions used for trial features cannot easily migrate to core elements
3. Existing content using extensions would become incompatible when features graduate

The request is to investigate and specify a mechanism that allows trial-use elements to be tested within normative resources, particularly through Additional Resource IGs.

## Current State

R6 Normative Approach:
- "ALL of the specification is being balloted as a full Normative ANSI Standard"
- Once normative, breaking changes require re-ballot
- New features must go through careful process

Current mechanisms for evolution:
- **Extensions**: Can add new functionality, but:
  - Different element paths than eventual core elements
  - Implementations using extensions need migration when features core-ify
  - Not all clients process extensions the same way

- **Additional Resource IGs**: 
  - Can define new resources/operations
  - Can extend existing resources via extensions
  - Same canonicals under http://hl7.org/fhir

The problem: There's no clean path from "trial extension" to "core element" without breaking implementations.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Bas van den Heuvel (Reporter)**: Concerned that normative status will freeze innovation. Requests investigation of mechanisms for trialing new elements within normative resources.

### Zulip Discussions

**Josh Mandel (Sep 2025, #fhir/infrastructure-wg > Additional Resources)**:
"Trial use elements within normative resources: it's not at all clear to me that implementers can tolerate these elements changing without breaking their implementations. This suggests that 'normative resources' still have risk of change that isn't well-communicated."

**Nick George (Sep 2023, #argonaut)**:
Asked about US Core policy for normative/mixed content - showing jurisdictional implementers share this concern.

**Elliot Silver (Multiple threads)**:
Discussed expectations about tracking changes and documentation requirements for evolving content.

## Related Issues & Discussions

### Conceptual Precedent
R4 had "trial use elements within normative resources" (e.g., some Observation elements). This caused confusion about stability guarantees.

### Additional Resources Architecture
Josh Mandel's Additional Resources summary notes that:
- Content can iterate in IGs between releases
- Eventually graduates to core (often normative) or retires
- Extensions are the mechanism for optional cross-links

### The Migration Problem
If a trial feature is tested via extension:
1. `Patient.extension[http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-foo]`
2. Feature proves useful, graduates to core
3. `Patient.foo` becomes core element
4. All implementations must migrate from extension to element
5. Validation changes, search parameters change, etc.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Stability vs Innovation Trade-off**:
   - Normative = stable, implementers can rely on it
   - Innovation requires trying new things that might not work
   - These are inherently in tension

2. **Possible Mechanisms**:
   - **Element-level standards status**: Mark specific elements as trial-use within normative resources
   - **Modifier extensions**: Trial features that affect interpretation
   - **Versioned elements**: Elements available in specific versions
   - **Feature flags**: CapabilityStatement-declared trial features

3. **Validation Complexity**:
   - Mixed standards status complicates validation
   - Which rules apply to trial elements in normative resources?

4. **Cross-Version Considerations**:
   - Trial element in R6 might become normative in R7
   - How do implementations handle the transition?

5. **IG Publisher Implications**:
   - How would Additional Resource IGs declare trial elements on core resources?
   - How would tooling validate against mixed specifications?

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Define Trial Element Extension Pattern
- **Description**: Create a standard pattern for "trial element extensions" that:
  - Use predictable URLs mapping to eventual element names
  - Have tooling support for migration when graduated
  - Are documented as potential future core elements
- **Pros**: Uses existing extension mechanism; clear expectation setting; tooling can support
- **Cons**: Still requires migration; doesn't solve fundamental problem
- **Impact**: Medium - pattern documentation and tooling

### Option B: Allow Element-Level Standards Status in Core
- **Description**: Allow normative resources to have trial-use elements marked with standards-status extension, similar to R4 approach
- **Pros**: Direct solution; elements are in "right place"; no migration needed
- **Cons**: Complicates normative guarantees; confuses implementers; validation complexity
- **Impact**: High - policy and tooling changes

### Option C: Additional Resource IG Element Contributions
- **Description**: Define mechanism for Additional Resource IGs to contribute elements (not just extensions) to core resources, with trial-use status
- **Pros**: Clean separation; IGs own evolution; tooling can merge
- **Cons**: Complex tooling; validation challenges; publishing complexity
- **Impact**: High - significant new capability

### Option D: Accept Extension Migration as Cost of Innovation
- **Description**: Document that extensions are the mechanism, migration is expected, and provide tooling/guidance to ease migration
- **Pros**: Simple; uses existing mechanisms; clear expectations
- **Cons**: Real migration burden on implementers; may discourage adoption of trial features
- **Impact**: Low - documentation and guidance

### Option E: Investigate and Report
- **Description**: Form a task force to investigate options, document trade-offs, and propose solution for future version
- **Pros**: Thoughtful approach; doesn't rush to wrong solution; includes community input
- **Cons**: Doesn't solve problem for R6; delays resolution
- **Impact**: Deferred - research action

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. How did R4's "trial use elements in normative resources" work in practice? What were the problems?

2. Is the migration burden from extensions to core elements actually significant?

3. Should Additional Resource IGs be able to contribute elements to core resources?

4. What guarantees do implementers actually need from "normative" status?

5. Are there examples from other standards bodies handling this tension?

6. Is this blocking for R6, or can it be addressed post-normative?
