# FHIR-55020: Add Additional Status Values and Other Relevant Metadata to List to Support Observation Grouping

## Issue Overview

This issue is a companion to FHIR-55019, which proposes adding List as a choice for DiagnosticReport.result to support grouping of observation panels. This issue (FHIR-55020) requests enhancements to the List resource itself to better support this clinical use case.

Specifically, the submitter suggests:
1. Adding additional status values appropriate for clinical results (List currently has status: current, retired, entered-in-error)
2. Possibly adding a new 'clinical-status' element for clinical list purposes
3. Adding other supporting metadata needed for observation grouping
4. Possibly adding a new List.mode code to support this specific use (though 'snapshot' may be usable)

This is part of the broader effort to resolve the laboratory panel representation debate in FHIR.

## Current State

**Current List.status values:**
- `current` - The list is considered to be an active list
- `retired` - The list is no longer actively maintained
- `entered-in-error` - The list was never accurate

**Current List.mode values:**
- `working` - A point-in-time list that tracks changes
- `snapshot` - A list that is only accurate at a point in time
- `changes` - A list that only represents changes to a previous list

These values were designed for administrative/workflow list use cases (e.g., problem lists, medication lists), not for clinical result grouping.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Robert Hausam** (Reporter):
- Proposing List as a grouper solution for observation panels
- Recognizes that if List is used clinically, it needs appropriate status values and metadata
- Notes that 'snapshot' mode is potentially usable but a more specific mode might be desirable

This is connected to the broader laboratory panel discussion involving:
- **Hans Buitendijk**: Suggested Group or List for grouping in FHIR-54562
- **Andrea Pitkus**: Concerned about using Observation as grouper
- **Michele Mottini**: Currently uses DiagnosticReport flat structure

## Technical Considerations

1. **Status Mismatch**: Clinical results need statuses like "preliminary", "final", "amended", "corrected" - these don't map to List's current vocabulary.

2. **Pattern Alignment**: If List is used for clinical grouping, should it implement any clinical patterns (like Event)?

3. **Metadata Needs**: Clinical result groupings may need:
   - Effective time
   - Performer
   - Specimen reference
   - Interpretation
   - Notes
   
4. **Scope Creep Risk**: Adding clinical features to List may turn it into something it wasn't designed to be.

5. **Alternative: Profile vs Core Change**: Could this be handled with a profile on List rather than core changes?

6. **List.mode**: The existing modes don't quite fit; 'snapshot' is closest but doesn't convey "clinical result grouping."

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Extend List.status ValueSet
- **Description**: Add clinical status values (preliminary, final, amended, corrected) to the List.status value set
- **Pros**: Simple extension; maintains single status element
- **Cons**: Mixes administrative and clinical statuses; may confuse existing List users
- **Impact**: Compatible, substantive change to terminology

### Option B: Add clinical-status Element
- **Description**: Add a new optional clinical-status element to List for clinical use cases
- **Pros**: Clean separation of concerns; doesn't affect existing usage
- **Cons**: Two status elements may be confusing; adds complexity
- **Impact**: Compatible, substantive structural change

### Option C: Create ClinicalList Profile
- **Description**: Define a profile on List with extensions for clinical metadata, rather than changing core
- **Pros**: No core changes; can be developed/tested in an IG first
- **Cons**: Extensions are less discoverable; profiles may not be consistently implemented
- **Impact**: Non-substantive to core; creates IG/profile

### Option D: Add observation-panel Mode
- **Description**: Add a new List.mode value specifically for "observation-panel" or "result-group"
- **Pros**: Clear indication of intent; simple terminology addition
- **Cons**: Doesn't address status/metadata needs
- **Impact**: Compatible, substantive terminology change

### Option E: Defer Until FHIR-55019 is Decided
- **Description**: Wait for the decision on whether List will be added to DiagnosticReport.result before making List enhancements
- **Pros**: Avoids premature optimization; changes only if needed
- **Cons**: May delay overall solution if FHIR-55019 is approved
- **Impact**: No immediate change

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. Should List be enhanced for clinical use, or should a different approach be used for observation grouping?

2. Is extending List.status preferable to adding a new clinical-status element?

3. What specific metadata elements would be needed if List is used for observation grouping?

4. Should this be handled via core changes or through a profile?

5. How does this coordinate with the O&O workgroup's decisions on panel representation?
