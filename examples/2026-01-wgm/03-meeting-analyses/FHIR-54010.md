# FHIR-54010: Add status element to ExtendedContactDetail

## Issue Overview

Mahesh Ravella (Epic) proposes adding a status element to the `ExtendedContactDetail` datatype. Currently, the only way to indicate whether a contact is active or inactive is through the `period` element (date range). The proposal suggests that a direct status indicator would be more useful in many scenarios.

This is a data modeling request to improve the usability of contact information across resources that use ExtendedContactDetail.

## Current State

**ExtendedContactDetail elements:**
- purpose (CodeableConcept)
- name (HumanName)
- telecom (ContactPoint, 0..*)
- address (Address)
- organization (Reference)
- period (Period) - only current mechanism for indicating active/inactive

**How inactive contacts are currently represented:**
- Set `period.end` to a past date
- Omit the contact entirely
- Use extensions

**Resources using ExtendedContactDetail:**
- Account.contact
- BodyStructure.includedStructure.bodyLandmarkOrientation.distanceFromLandmark.device
- CareTeam.participant
- Coverage.paymentBy
- HealthcareService.contact
- InsurancePlan.contact
- Location.contact
- Organization.contact
- Patient.contact (indirectly, via contained resources)
- And others...

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Reporter (Mahesh Ravella, Epic)**: Sees value in explicit status rather than inferring from date ranges. This likely reflects real-world system design where contacts have explicit active/inactive flags.

## Related Issues & Discussions

**Zulip**: No direct discussions found on ExtendedContactDetail status. However, status elements are common across FHIR resources and datatypes, suggesting this aligns with broader patterns.

**Related patterns in FHIR:**
- `ContactPoint.use` includes values like "old" that indicate no longer in use
- Many resources have explicit `status` elements (Patient.active, Organization.active, etc.)
- Address has `use` with "old" value

## Technical Considerations

1. **Period vs Status**: Period provides more information (when active, when ended) but requires date reasoning. Status is simpler but less informative.

2. **Consistency with ContactPoint**: ContactPoint.use has "old" value to indicate no longer in use. ExtendedContactDetail contains ContactPoint elements - should status be at ContactPoint level or ExtendedContactDetail level?

3. **Semantic overlap**: With both `period` and `status`, what happens if they conflict (status=active but period.end is in the past)?

4. **Binding strength**: What value set should be used? Simple active/inactive? Include "entered-in-error"?

5. **Impact breadth**: ExtendedContactDetail is used across many resources - adding status affects all of them.

6. **Normative type**: ExtendedContactDetail is a metadata type. Changes have broad implications.

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Add Status Element
- **Description**: Add `status` element with values like active/inactive
- **Pros**: 
  - Direct indication of contact validity
  - Simpler than date calculations
  - Consistent with resource-level patterns
- **Cons**: 
  - Potential redundancy with period
  - Need to define conflict resolution rules
  - Adds complexity to already complex type
- **Impact**: Compatible, substantive (new element)

### Option B: Recommend Using Period
- **Description**: Document that period should be used to indicate active/inactive status; clarify usage patterns
- **Pros**: 
  - No structural change
  - Period provides more information than binary status
  - Already available
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires date reasoning
  - Less intuitive for simple active/inactive needs
  - Doesn't address reporter's concern
- **Impact**: Non-substantive (documentation)

### Option C: Add Status as Optional with Period Priority
- **Description**: Add status element, document that period takes precedence if both present
- **Pros**: 
  - Provides flexibility
  - Clear conflict resolution
  - Addresses reporter need
- **Cons**: 
  - Complexity of having both
  - Implementation must handle both
- **Impact**: Compatible, substantive

### Option D: Define Standard Extension
- **Description**: Create standard extension for status rather than adding to core type
- **Pros**: 
  - Doesn't change core type
  - Can be adopted where needed
- **Cons**: 
  - Less discoverable
  - Not as clean as native element
  - Extension adoption varies
- **Impact**: Non-substantive

### Option E: Defer - Evaluate Broader Contact Modeling
- **Description**: Evaluate contact modeling more broadly before making targeted changes
- **Pros**: 
  - Holistic approach
  - May identify better overall solution
- **Cons**: 
  - Delays resolution
  - May be scope creep
- **Impact**: None (deferred)

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. Is the current period-based approach insufficient for real-world needs?

2. If adding status, what values should be included? (active, inactive, entered-in-error?)

3. How should conflicts between status and period be resolved?

4. Should this align with ContactPoint.use patterns?

5. Is there implementation experience showing period is inadequate?

6. Are there other ExtendedContactDetail improvements that should be considered together?
