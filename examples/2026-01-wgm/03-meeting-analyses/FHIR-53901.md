# FHIR-53901: Workflow Page: Open Issues

## Issue Overview

This ballot comment identifies that the Workflow page (https://build.fhir.org/workflow.html) still contains an "Open Issues" section (section 15.8.2) with unresolved questions that arguably should be addressed before the content becomes normative.

The workflow page itself is marked as "Informative," but the commenter correctly notes that the open issues within it address content that will become normative. This creates a situation where normative content may have unresolved design questions that could affect implementations.

## Current State

The Workflow page section 15.8.2 "Open Issues" currently lists these unresolved questions:

1. **MessageHeader/Task overlap**: Whether portions of MessageHeader could be replaced with Task references for consistency between REST and messaging paradigms
2. **OperationDefinition for Task types**: Whether OperationDefinition is appropriate for defining task types and their parameters
3. **Resource overlap**: Whether SupplyRequest, DeviceRequest, and VisionPrescription should remain distinct resources given their significant overlap
4. **SpecimenDefinition categorization**: Notes that SpecimenDefinition defines a 'thing' not an action, questioning its placement in the Definitions group

These are substantive architectural questions that have implementation implications for systems building workflow capabilities.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Reinhard Egelkraut (Reporter)**: Raised the concern that open issues addressing normative content should be resolved before going normative, as the questions directly impact how the normative resources should be used.

No comments have been added to the issue yet, suggesting this may need broader discussion.

## Related Issues & Discussions

- No directly linked Jira issues found
- The Workflow page is owned by FHIR Infrastructure Work Group
- Related to the broader R6 normative readiness effort

## Technical Considerations

1. **Normative vs Informative**: The page is informative, but the questions affect normative resources (MessageHeader, Task, OperationDefinition, SupplyRequest, DeviceRequest, VisionPrescription, SpecimenDefinition)

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Some of these questions (like merging SupplyRequest/DeviceRequest/VisionPrescription) would have significant breaking change implications if resolved after R6 goes normative

3. **Implementation Guidance**: Implementers rely on workflow documentation for architectural decisions - unresolved questions create uncertainty

4. **Scope**: Some questions may be "known ambiguities" that are acceptable to carry forward, while others might need resolution

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Resolve All Open Issues Before Normative Ballot
- **Description**: Work through each open issue and make decisions, removing the Open Issues section
- **Pros**: Clean normative specification without acknowledged gaps; clear guidance for implementers
- **Cons**: May delay ballot if resolution requires significant discussion; some issues may not have clear consensus
- **Impact**: High - requires immediate work group attention on each item

### Option B: Convert Open Issues to Formal Tracker Items
- **Description**: Create individual Jira tickets for each open issue, mark them as "known issues" for future versions, and document that these questions exist but don't block normative status
- **Pros**: Acknowledges issues formally; allows tracking; doesn't block normative progress
- **Cons**: Doesn't actually resolve the questions; may affect implementation confidence
- **Impact**: Medium - requires creating tickets and updating documentation

### Option C: Remove Open Issues Section, Note in Informative Text
- **Description**: Since the page is informative, remove the "Open Issues" section and instead note in the regular text that certain architectural choices exist
- **Pros**: Removes appearance of unfinished work; informative text can acknowledge alternatives
- **Cons**: Hides rather than addresses the underlying questions
- **Impact**: Low - editorial change

### Option D: Keep Open Issues Section with Clarifying Note
- **Description**: Add a note that these are "long-standing design considerations" rather than "blocking issues," clarifying they don't affect normative status
- **Pros**: Transparent about architectural alternatives; doesn't require resolving complex issues
- **Cons**: May seem like incomplete specification to some balloters
- **Impact**: Low - editorial addition

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. Which of the four open issues listed actually need resolution before normative, and which are acceptable as ongoing design alternatives?

2. For the MessageHeader/Task question: Is there active implementation experience that would inform this decision?

3. For the SupplyRequest/DeviceRequest/VisionPrescription overlap: Is consolidation even possible given normative constraints, or should this question be retired?

4. Is SpecimenDefinition actually misplaced, or is the categorization acceptable as-is?

5. What is the precedent for having "Open Issues" sections in informative pages that reference normative content?
