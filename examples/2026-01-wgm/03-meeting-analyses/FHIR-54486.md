# FHIR-54486: Remove FML Tutorial - doesn't belong in the core FHIR specification

## Issue Overview

Brian Postlethwaite argues that the FHIR Mapping Language (FML) tutorial should be removed from the core FHIR specification. His reasoning is that this is the ONLY tutorial in the entire specification, making it an anomaly in the document structure.

The suggestion is that tutorial content is better suited for an Implementation Guide or Confluence documentation, where it can be maintained separately and updated more frequently without requiring specification ballot cycles.

More broadly, Brian suggests that all FML content might be better served in a separate specification, which would also address the related issues about FML documentation gaps (FHIR-54481, FHIR-54483, FHIR-54484).

## Current State

The FML tutorial is located at https://hl7.org/fhir/6.0.0-ballot4/mapping-tutorial.html and provides:
- Step-by-step introduction to FML concepts
- Progressive examples building in complexity
- Explanations of mapping scenarios

This tutorial is indeed unique - no other part of the core FHIR specification includes tutorial-style documentation. The rest of the spec follows a reference documentation style (definitions, constraints, examples).

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Reporter (Brian Postlethwaite):** Advocates for clean separation between normative specification content and educational/tutorial content. Notes that having FML in a separate spec would address multiple related issues.

No other comments have been posted yet.

### Zulip Discussions
- Users in #FHIR Mapping Language frequently reference the tutorial, suggesting it has value
- Some discussion about tutorial clarity, with users saying they'd "pay $10" for clearer FML docs
- The tutorial is cited as a learning resource, but also as source of confusion about implicit behaviors

## Related Issues & Discussions

- **FHIR-54481**: No official FML to StructureMap mapping
- **FHIR-54483**: Error reporting format questions
- **FHIR-54484**: Transform functions documentation gaps
- All these could potentially be addressed by creating a dedicated FML specification

## Technical Considerations

1. **Normative vs Educational Content**: Tutorials are educational by nature and don't fit the normative pattern of the core spec

2. **Maintenance Burden**: Tutorial content often needs more frequent updates than normative specification text

3. **URL Stability**: If removed, existing links to the tutorial would break (or need redirects)

4. **FML Ecosystem**: The tutorial is often the first introduction people have to FML - its location affects discoverability

5. **Precedent**: If kept, other areas might request tutorials (FHIRPath, profiling, etc.)

## Potential Courses of Action

### Option A: Remove Tutorial, Create FML Implementation Guide
- **Description**: Extract the entire FML specification (tutorial, reference docs, transform functions) into a standalone Implementation Guide with its own publication cycle
- **Pros**: 
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - FML can evolve independently of FHIR core releases
  - Addresses multiple related Jira issues (54481, 54483, 54484)
  - IG can include tutorials, examples, test cases without spec constraints
- **Cons**: 
  - Significant effort to create and maintain separate IG
  - May reduce visibility of FML as a core FHIR capability
  - Migration path needed for existing content and links
  - StructureMap resource still in core spec - creates dependency
- **Impact**: High effort, strategic long-term solution

### Option B: Move Tutorial to Confluence/Wiki
- **Description**: Keep FML reference documentation in core spec, but move the tutorial to HL7 Confluence or a community wiki
- **Pros**: 
  - Quick to implement
  - Tutorial can be updated without ballot
  - Core spec remains clean reference material
- **Cons**: 
  - Reduces discoverability of tutorial
  - Confluence/wiki content is less "official"
  - Link maintenance issues
- **Impact**: Low effort, partial solution

### Option C: Keep Tutorial But Restructure
- **Description**: Keep the tutorial in the spec but clearly mark it as "Informative" (non-normative) and reorganize to be consistent with other informative content
- **Pros**: 
  - Maintains discoverability
  - Acknowledges different nature of content
  - No link breakage
- **Cons**: 
  - Still an anomaly in spec structure
  - May set precedent for other tutorials
  - Doesn't address broader FML documentation issues
- **Impact**: Low effort, maintains status quo with labeling

### Option D: Status Quo
- **Description**: Keep the tutorial as-is, recognizing that FML is complex enough to warrant special treatment
- **Pros**: 
  - No work required
  - Tutorial remains accessible
  - Users have found it valuable
- **Cons**: 
  - Inconsistent spec structure
  - Doesn't address the valid architectural concern
- **Impact**: No effort, maintains current inconsistency

## Questions for the Workgroup

1. Is there a principled reason to have tutorial content in the core spec, or is this a historical accident?

2. If the tutorial is removed, where should it live to maintain discoverability?

3. Should this decision be made in conjunction with the broader question of FML as a separate specification?

4. Are there other areas of the spec where tutorial content would be valuable, and should we have a consistent policy?

5. What is the cost/benefit of maintaining tutorial content through the ballot process vs. a more agile publication method?
